For my collaborators to pull and start working:

Steps:

1. Each collaborator should open their Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (cmd) (Windows)
2. Go to the location where you want to clone the project
3. Type "git clone https://github.com/ishaq-ansari/Momentum.git" without the quote. This will create a folder called "Momentum" in your current directory.
4. Then, type "git pull origin main"
5. Start working and making changes
6. Once you're done, type "git add ."
7. Type <git commit -m "Give a descriptive comment of what you updated"> without the anchor
8. Type "git push origin main"


Starting from next time, just go the to the folder Momementum and just type these to pull the last updated one:
Pull:
1. git pull origin main

Push
1. git commit -m "Give a descriptive comment of what you updated"
2. git push origin main
